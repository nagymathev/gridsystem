# Some sort of Inventory System perhaps with a sprinkle of game.

TODO:
- Figure out some sort of overlay method instead of changing the colors of the items.
    - This could be made using a separate mouse class that handles interactions with the inventories.
- Introduce multiple inventories to pass items in between.

- Make item visible while moving it. (2025-12-31)
