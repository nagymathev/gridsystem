# Some sort of Inventory System perhaps with a sprinkle of game.

TODO:
- Don't remove item until it is placed. With this can put item back when trying to place it at an illegal location.
- Have items be able to define their own colour.

Changelog

- Can no longer place items out of bounds and crash the game (2025-12-31)
- Can move items in the inventory grid (2025-12-30)
